### **6. Netlify (Frontend) + Render Free (Backend)** ⚠️
**Use Netlify instead of Render for frontend**

Since you're using Render premium for another project, you could:
- Deploy Luffy **frontend** to Netlify (free)
- Deploy Luffy **backend** to Render free tier
- This separates them from your premium project

**Website**: https://netlify.com
